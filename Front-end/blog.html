                <p>When I released my first theme last year, I never imagined that it would lead me to releasing multiple commercial themes that would actually help pay the bills.  I only did it because I enjoyed designing websites and I wanted to play around with jQuery Masonry, which had just came out.  I spent the weekend tinkering around with a gallery theme idea and released it the next Monday for free.  It was just very basic, lacked commenting functionality, and was completely CSS.  I figured a couple people would download it.  I was wrong…a lot of people downloaded it, and they were hungry for more features.  After several months and a couple hundred comments on the original blog post, I decided to dip my toes into the commercial theme market.  I haven’t regretted it ever since.</p>
